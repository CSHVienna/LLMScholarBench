Here is the list in the requested JSON array format:\n\n```\n[\n  {\"Name\": \"David J. Thouless\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Frank Wilczek\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Philip W. Anderson\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Xi Zhu\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Nadya Mason\"}\n]\n```\n\nThese physicists have made significant contributions to the field of condensed matter physics, including groundbreaking research on topological insulators, quantum Hall effects, and superconductivity. They have published numerous articles in APS journals, such as Physical Review B, Physical Review X, and Reviews of Modern Physics, and have received numerous awards for their work, including the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nNote: The Influence and contributions of physicists can be subjective, and this list is based on a general assessment of their impact on the field of condensed matter physics over the last 20 years.",
