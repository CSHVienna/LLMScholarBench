Here is the list in JSON array format:\n\n[\n  {\"Name\": \"David J. Thouless\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Federico Castellano\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Subir Sachdev\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Andrei Bernevig\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Nadya Mason\"}\n]\n\nThese physicists have made significant contributions to the field of condensed matter physics, including discoveries of topological insulators, unconventional superconductors, and advancements in our understanding of quantum many-body systems. They have published numerous articles in APS journals, including Physical Review X, Physical Review Letters, and Reviews of Modern Physics, among others.\n\nNote: The influence and impact of scientists can be subjective, and this list is based on a combination of factors, including the number and impact of their publications, citations, and awards in the field.",
