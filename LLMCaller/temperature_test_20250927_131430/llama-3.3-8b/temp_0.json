Here is the list in the requested JSON array format:\n\n```\n[\n  {\"Name\": \"David H. Lee\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Subir Sachdev\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Andrea C. Fang\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Nadia F. Prokof'ev\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Liang Fu\"}\n]\n```\n\nThese physicists have made significant contributions to the field of condensed matter physics, publishing numerous articles in APS journals such as Physical Review X, Physical Review Letters, and Reviews of Modern Physics. They have advanced our understanding of topological insulators, superconductivity, and other areas of condensed matter physics.\n\nNote: The influence and impact of scientists can be subjective, and this list is based on a combination of factors including publication record, citation count, and recognition within the scientific community.",
