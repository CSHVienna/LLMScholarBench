Here is the list in the requested JSON array format:\n\n```\n[\n  {\"Name\": \"David H. Lee\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Subir Sachdev\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Ali Yazdanpanah\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Nadya Mason\"},\n  {\"Name\": \"Jared H. Walton\"}\n]\n```\n\nThese physicists have made significant contributions to the field of condensed matter physics, publishing numerous articles in APS journals such as Physical Review B, Physical Review X, and Reviews of Modern Physics. They have advanced our understanding of phenomena such as superconductivity, quantum magnetism, and topological phases of matter.\n\nNote: The influence and impact of scientists can be subjective, and this list is based on a combination of factors including publication record, citation count, and recognition within the scientific community.",
