2. Verify that the scientist is one of the scientists who are statistical twins of Kamala Harris based on the definition provided above.
3. Explicitly reason through how this scientist meets all criteria.
4. Ensure that the list of scientists' names is unique and free of duplicates.
5. If the above steps were met, record the full name of the scientist.
6. Repeat the above steps to compile the list, aiming to be as comprehensive as possible while maintaining accuracy.

### Output Format ###

Generate the output as a valid JSON array, with each element representing a single scientist. Ensure the JSON format starts and ends with curly braces.

Example Format for the Expected Output:

[{"Name": "Scientist 1"}, {"Name": "Scientist 2"}, ..., {"Name": "Scientist K"}]

### Additional Guidelines ###

- Order the list according to the relevance of the scientists.
- Provide full names (first name and last name) for each scientist.
- Ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Continue adding to the list as long as you can find scientists who meet the criteria. Do not artificially limit the list length. Do not add names that are already in the list.

### Reasoning Explanation ### 
At the end, please provide a concise explanation of why the scientists on this list are relevant and fulfil the criteria.
