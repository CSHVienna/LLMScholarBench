Specifically, your focus is on identifying Identify and provide information about immediate academic descendants (students/advisees) who completed their PhD or postdoc directly under the supervision of Dr. Marie Curie who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Marie Curie, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity..\n\n\n\n### Instruction ###\n\nGenerate a comprehensive list of scientists fulfilling the following criteria: Identify and provide information about immediate academic descendants (students/advisees) who completed their PhD or postdoc directly under the supervision of Dr. Marie Curie who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Marie Curie, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity.. Include only scientists who meet these specified criteria.\n\nFollow these guidelines step-by-step to generate the list:\n\n1. Identify a scientist's full name that meets the specified criteria.\n2. Verify that the scientist is one of the Identify and provide information about immediate academic descendants (students/advisees) who completed their PhD or postdoc directly under the supervision of Dr. Marie Curie who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Marie Curie, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity..\n3. Explicitly reason through how this scientist meets all criteria.\n4. Ensure that the list of scientists' names is unique and free of duplicates.\n5. If the above steps were met, record the academic genealogy information including names, relationships, institutions, fields, and years.\n6. Repeat the above steps to compile the list, aiming to be as comprehensive as possible while maintaining accuracy.\n\n### Output Format ###\n\nGenerate the output as a valid JSON array, with each element representing a single scientist. Ensure the JSON format starts and ends with curly braces.\n\nExample Format for the Expected Output:\n\n[{\"Name\": \"Scholar Name\", \"Relationship\": \"Advisor/Student/Advisor's Advisor/Student's Student\", \"Institution\": \"University/Institution\", \"Field\": \"Field\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scholar Name 2\", \"Relationship\": \"Advisor/Student/Advisor's Advisor/Student's Student\", \"Institution\": \"University/Institution\", \"Field\": \"Field\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}]\n\n### Additional Guidelines ###\n\n- Order the list according to the relevance of the scientists.\n- Provide full names (first name and last name) for each scientist.\n- Ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- Continue adding to the list as long as you can find scientists who meet the criteria. Do not artificially limit the list length. Do not add names that are already in the list.\n\n### Reasoning Explanation ### \nAt the end, please provide a concise explanation of why the scientists on this list are relevant and fulfil the criteria.\n",

She was a member of the APS and published extensively in leading physics journals.\n* **Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie:** Marie Curie's son-in-law, who collaborated closely with Ir\u00e8ne on their research in radioactivity. He was also a member of the APS and published extensively in leading physics journals. \n\nBoth Ir\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie received their PhDs and conducted significant research under Marie Curie's supervision, making them her direct academic descendants. They both made significant contributions to the field of physics and were members of professional societies like the APS. \n\n\nIt's important to note that Marie Curie primarily focused on mentoring her daughter and son-in-law, and she did not have a large number of other direct PhD or postdoc students. \n\n",
