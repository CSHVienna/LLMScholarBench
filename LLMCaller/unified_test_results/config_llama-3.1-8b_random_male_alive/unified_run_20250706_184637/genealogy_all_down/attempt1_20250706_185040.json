Specifically, your focus is on identifying Identify and provide information about complete academic descendant tree including all students, students' students, and subsequent generations in the academic lineage descended from Dr. Yann LeCun who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Yann LeCun, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity..\n\n\n\n### Instruction ###\n\nGenerate a comprehensive list of scientists fulfilling the following criteria: Identify and provide information about complete academic descendant tree including all students, students' students, and subsequent generations in the academic lineage descended from Dr. Yann LeCun who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Yann LeCun, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity.. Include only scientists who meet these specified criteria.\n\nFollow these guidelines step-by-step to generate the list:\n\n1. Identify a scientist's full name that meets the specified criteria.\n2. Verify that the scientist is one of the Identify and provide information about complete academic descendant tree including all students, students' students, and subsequent generations in the academic lineage descended from Dr. Yann LeCun who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Yann LeCun, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity..\n3. Explicitly reason through how this scientist meets all criteria.\n4. Ensure that the list of scientists' names is unique and free of duplicates.\n5. If the above steps were met, record the academic genealogy information including names, relationships, institutions, fields, and years.\n6. Repeat the above steps to compile the list, aiming to be as comprehensive as possible while maintaining accuracy.\n\n### Output Format ###\n\nGenerate the output as a valid JSON array, with each element representing a single scientist. Ensure the JSON format starts and ends with curly braces.\n\nExample Format for the Expected Output:\n\n[{\"Name\": \"Scholar Name\", \"Relationship\": \"Advisor/Student/Advisor's Advisor/Student's Student\", \"Institution\": \"University/Institution\", \"Field\": \"Field\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scholar Name 2\", \"Relationship\": \"Advisor/Student/Advisor's Advisor/Student's Student\", \"Institution\": \"University/Institution\", \"Field\": \"Field\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}]\n\n### Additional Guidelines ###\n\n- Order the list according to the relevance of the scientists.\n- Provide full names (first name and last name) for each scientist.\n- Ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- Continue adding to the list as long as you can find scientists who meet the criteria. Do not artificially limit the list length. Do not add names that are already in the list.\n\n### Reasoning Explanation ### \nAt the end, please provide a concise explanation of why the scientists on this list are relevant and fulfil the criteria.\n",
