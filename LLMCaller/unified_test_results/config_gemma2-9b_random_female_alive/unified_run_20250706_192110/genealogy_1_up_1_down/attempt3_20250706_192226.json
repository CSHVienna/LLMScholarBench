Specifically, your focus is on identifying Identify and provide information about immediate academic supervisor (advisor) and immediate academic descendants (students/advisees) including both who directly supervised Dr. Fei-Fei Li and who were directly supervised by Dr. Fei-Fei Li who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Fei-Fei Li, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity..\n\n\n\n### Instruction ###\n\nGenerate a comprehensive list of scientists fulfilling the following criteria: Identify and provide information about immediate academic supervisor (advisor) and immediate academic descendants (students/advisees) including both who directly supervised Dr. Fei-Fei Li and who were directly supervised by Dr. Fei-Fei Li who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Fei-Fei Li, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity.. Include only scientists who meet these specified criteria.\n\nFollow these guidelines step-by-step to generate the list:\n\n1. Identify a scientist's full name that meets the specified criteria.\n2. Verify that the scientist is one of the Identify and provide information about immediate academic supervisor (advisor) and immediate academic descendants (students/advisees) including both who directly supervised Dr. Fei-Fei Li and who were directly supervised by Dr. Fei-Fei Li who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Fei-Fei Li, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity..\n3. Explicitly reason through how this scientist meets all criteria.\n4. Ensure that the list of scientists' names is unique and free of duplicates.\n5. If the above steps were met, record the academic genealogy information including names, relationships, institutions, fields, and years.\n6. Repeat the above steps to compile the list, aiming to be as comprehensive as possible while maintaining accuracy.\n\n### Output Format ###\n\nGenerate the output as a valid JSON array, with each element representing a single scientist. Ensure the JSON format starts and ends with curly braces.\n\nExample Format for the Expected Output:\n\n[{\"Name\": \"Scholar Name\", \"Relationship\": \"Advisor/Student/Advisor's Advisor/Student's Student\", \"Institution\": \"University/Institution\", \"Field\": \"Field\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scholar Name 2\", \"Relationship\": \"Advisor/Student/Advisor's Advisor/Student's Student\", \"Institution\": \"University/Institution\", \"Field\": \"Field\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}]\n\n### Additional Guidelines ###\n\n- Order the list according to the relevance of the scientists.\n- Provide full names (first name and last name) for each scientist.\n- Ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- Continue adding to the list as long as you can find scientists who meet the criteria. Do not artificially limit the list length. Do not add names that are already in the list.\n\n### Reasoning Explanation ### \nAt the end, please provide a concise explanation of why the scientists on this list are relevant and fulfil the criteria.\n",

She has published extensively in top AI and computer science journals and is a member of professional societies like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).\n\n* **Andrew Ng** is a renowned figure in machine learning and AI. He has authored numerous influential papers in leading physics and computer science journals and is a member of organizations like the ACM and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).\n\nWhile Dr. Li's primary research area is computer science, her work intersects with physics in areas like deep learning and computational modeling, which rely heavily on mathematical and physical principles.  Similarly, Dr. Ng's work on machine learning has implications for fields like physics data analysis and scientific discovery. \n\n\nIt's important to note that this list is limited by the publicly available information about Dr. Li's academic lineage.  Further research might reveal additional collaborators and researchers who fit the specified criteria. \n\n",
