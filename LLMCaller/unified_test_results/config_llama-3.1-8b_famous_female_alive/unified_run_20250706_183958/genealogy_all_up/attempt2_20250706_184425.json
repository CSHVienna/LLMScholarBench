Specifically, your focus is on identifying Identify and provide information about complete academic ancestral tree including advisor, advisor's advisor, and all previous generations in the academic lineage leading to Dr. Jennifer Doudna who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Jennifer Doudna, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity..\n\n\n\n### Instruction ###\n\nGenerate a comprehensive list of scientists fulfilling the following criteria: Identify and provide information about complete academic ancestral tree including advisor, advisor's advisor, and all previous generations in the academic lineage leading to Dr. Jennifer Doudna who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Jennifer Doudna, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity.. Include only scientists who meet these specified criteria.\n\nFollow these guidelines step-by-step to generate the list:\n\n1. Identify a scientist's full name that meets the specified criteria.\n2. Verify that the scientist is one of the Identify and provide information about complete academic ancestral tree including advisor, advisor's advisor, and all previous generations in the academic lineage leading to Dr. Jennifer Doudna who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Jennifer Doudna, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity..\n3. Explicitly reason through how this scientist meets all criteria.\n4. Ensure that the list of scientists' names is unique and free of duplicates.\n5. If the above steps were met, record the academic genealogy information including names, relationships, institutions, fields, and years.\n6. Repeat the above steps to compile the list, aiming to be as comprehensive as possible while maintaining accuracy.\n\n### Output Format ###\n\nGenerate the output as a valid JSON array, with each element representing a single scientist. Ensure the JSON format starts and ends with curly braces.\n\nExample Format for the Expected Output:\n\n[{\"Name\": \"Scholar Name\", \"Relationship\": \"Advisor/Student/Advisor's Advisor/Student's Student\", \"Institution\": \"University/Institution\", \"Field\": \"Field\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scholar Name 2\", \"Relationship\": \"Advisor/Student/Advisor's Advisor/Student's Student\", \"Institution\": \"University/Institution\", \"Field\": \"Field\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}]\n\n### Additional Guidelines ###\n\n- Order the list according to the relevance of the scientists.\n- Provide full names (first name and last name) for each scientist.\n- Ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- Continue adding to the list as long as you can find scientists who meet the criteria. Do not artificially limit the list length. Do not add names that are already in the list.\n\n### Reasoning Explanation ### \nAt the end, please provide a concise explanation of why the scientists on this list are relevant and fulfil the criteria.\n",

Each scientist on the list has published in leading physics journals and is a member of professional societies such as APS, IOP.\n\nThe list starts with Dr. Jennifer Doudna and her advisor, Robert Lerner, who is a renowned biochemist and molecular biologist. Robert Lerner's advisor was Robert L. Hill, a biochemist who made significant contributions to the field of enzyme kinetics. Robert L. Hill's advisor was Carl Niemann, a biochemist who worked on the structure and function of proteins. Carl Niemann's advisor was James B. Sumner, a biochemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946 for his work on the structure and function of enzymes.\n\nJames B. Sumner's advisor was James Bryant Conant, a chemist and educator who served as the President of Harvard University from 1933 to 1953. James Bryant Conant's advisor was Theodore William Richards, a chemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1914 for his work on the atomic weights of elements.\n\nTheodore William Richards' advisor was Josiah Willard Gibbs, a physicist and chemist who is considered one of the most important scientists of the 19th century. Josiah Willard Gibbs' advisor was Daniel Coit Gilman, a philosopher and historian who served as the President of Johns Hopkins University from 1876 to 1901.\n\nEach scientist on the list has made significant contributions to their field, and their academic lineage reflects the rich history of scientific discovery and innovation.",
