Specifically, your focus is on identifying Identify and provide information about immediate academic supervisor (advisor) who directly supervised Dr. Marie Curie during their PhD or postdoc who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Marie Curie, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity..\n\n\n\n### Instruction ###\n\nGenerate a comprehensive list of scientists fulfilling the following criteria: Identify and provide information about immediate academic supervisor (advisor) who directly supervised Dr. Marie Curie during their PhD or postdoc who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Marie Curie, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity.. Include only scientists who meet these specified criteria.\n\nFollow these guidelines step-by-step to generate the list:\n\n1. Identify a scientist's full name that meets the specified criteria.\n2. Verify that the scientist is one of the Identify and provide information about immediate academic supervisor (advisor) who directly supervised Dr. Marie Curie during their PhD or postdoc who have published in leading physics journals and are members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. For each person, include their name, relationship to Dr. Marie Curie, institution, field of study, and approximate years of activity..\n3. Explicitly reason through how this scientist meets all criteria.\n4. Ensure that the list of scientists' names is unique and free of duplicates.\n5. If the above steps were met, record the academic genealogy information including names, relationships, institutions, fields, and years.\n6. Repeat the above steps to compile the list, aiming to be as comprehensive as possible while maintaining accuracy.\n\n### Output Format ###\n\nGenerate the output as a valid JSON array, with each element representing a single scientist. Ensure the JSON format starts and ends with curly braces.\n\nExample Format for the Expected Output:\n\n[{\"Name\": \"Scholar Name\", \"Relationship\": \"Advisor/Student/Advisor's Advisor/Student's Student\", \"Institution\": \"University/Institution\", \"Field\": \"Field\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scholar Name 2\", \"Relationship\": \"Advisor/Student/Advisor's Advisor/Student's Student\", \"Institution\": \"University/Institution\", \"Field\": \"Field\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}]\n\n### Additional Guidelines ###\n\n- Order the list according to the relevance of the scientists.\n- Provide full names (first name and last name) for each scientist.\n- Ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- Continue adding to the list as long as you can find scientists who meet the criteria. Do not artificially limit the list length. Do not add names that are already in the list.\n\n### Reasoning Explanation ### \nAt the end, please provide a concise explanation of why the scientists on this list are relevant and fulfil the criteria.\n",

The criteria for inclusion in the list are:\n\n1. The scientist must have supervised Dr. Marie Curie during her PhD or postdoc.\n2. The scientist must have published in leading physics journals.\n3. The scientist must be a member of professional societies such as APS, IOP.\n\nThe scientists included in the list meet these criteria:\n\n1. **Pierre Curie**: Pierre Curie was Dr. Marie Curie's advisor during her PhD at the University of Paris. He was a renowned physicist who made significant contributions to the field of magnetism and piezoelectricity. He was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and published numerous papers in leading physics journals.\n2. **Gabriel Lippmann**: Gabriel Lippmann was Dr. Marie Curie's advisor during her early years at the University of Paris. He was a physicist who made significant contributions to the field of optics and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908. He was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and published numerous papers in leading physics journals.\n3. **Jean Perrier**: Jean Perrier was Dr. Marie Curie's advisor during her early years at the University of Paris. He was a physicist who made significant contributions to the field of physics and was a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He published numerous papers in leading physics journals.\n\nThe list is ordered according to the relevance of the scientists, with Pierre Curie being the most relevant as he was Dr. Marie Curie's direct advisor. The list is also free of duplicates and includes only scientists who meet the specified criteria.\n\n### Reasoning Explanation\n\nThe scientists on this list are relevant and fulfill the criteria because they were directly involved in Dr. Marie Curie's academic career, supervised her during her PhD or postdoc, and made significant contributions to the field of physics. They also published numerous papers in leading physics journals and were members of professional societies such as APS, IOP. This list provides a comprehensive overview of the academic genealogy of Dr. Marie Curie and highlights the importance of her supervisors in shaping her career and contributions to physics.",
