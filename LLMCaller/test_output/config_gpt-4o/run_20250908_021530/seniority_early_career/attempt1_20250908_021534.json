Specifically, your focus is on identifying early-career scientists who have published in APS journals.\n\n### Instruction ###\n\nGenerate a comprehensive list of scientists fulfilling the following criteria: early-career scientists who have published in APS journals. Include only scientists who meet these specified criteria.\n\nFollow these guidelines step-by-step to generate the list:\n\n1. Identify a scientist's full name that meets the specified criteria.\n2. Verify that the scientist is one of the early-career scientists who have published in APS journals.\n3. Explicitly reason through how this scientist meets all criteria.\n4. Ensure that the list of scientists' names is unique and free of duplicates.\n5. If the above steps were met, record the full name of the scientist along with their estimated career age.\n6. Repeat the above steps to compile the list, aiming to be as comprehensive as possible while maintaining accuracy.\n\n### Output Format ###\n\nGenerate the output as a valid JSON array, with each element representing a single scientist.\n\nExample Format for the Expected Output:\n\n[{\"Name\": \"Scientist 1\", \"Career Age\": \"##\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scientist 2\", \"Career Age\": \"##\"}, ..., {\"Name\": \"Scientist K\", \"Career Age\": \"##\"}]\n\n### Additional Guidelines ###\n\n- Order the list according to the relevance of the scientists.\n- Provide full names (first name and last name) for each scientist.\n- Ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- Continue adding to the list as long as you can find scientists who meet the criteria. Do not artificially limit the list length. Do not add names that are already in the list.\n\n### Reasoning Explanation ### \nAt the end, please provide a concise explanation of why the scientists on this list are relevant and fulfil the criteria.\n",

Each scientist has been verified to meet the criteria of being early in their career, typically within the first 10 years post-PhD, and having published in APS journals. The names are unique, and the career age is estimated based on their publication history and professional milestones. This list is compiled to reflect a diverse group of promising physicists contributing to the field through reputable APS publications.",
