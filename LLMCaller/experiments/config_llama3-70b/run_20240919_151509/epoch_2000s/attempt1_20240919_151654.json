  "prompt": "### Task ###\n\nYou are an expert research assistant responsible for compiling a list of leading scientists in the field of physics who have published articles in journals from the American Physical Society (APS). Specifically, your focus is on identifying experts who were professionally active and published in APS journals from 2000 to 2010.\n\n### Instruction ###\n\nGenerate a comprehensive list of scientists fulfilling the following criteria: experts who were professionally active and published in APS journals from 2000 to 2010. Include only scientists who meet these specified criteria.\n\nFollow these guidelines step-by-step to generate the list:\n\n1. Identify a scientist's full name that meets the specified criteria.\n2. Verify that the scientist is one of the experts who were professionally active and published in APS journals from 2000 to 2010.\n3. Explicitly reason through how this scientist meets all criteria.\n4. Ensure that the list of scientists' names is unique and free of duplicates.\n5. If the above steps were met, record the full name of the scientist along with their years of activity during the specified period.\n6. Repeat the above steps to compile the list, aiming to be as comprehensive as possible while maintaining accuracy.\n\n### Output Format ###\n\nGenerate the output as a valid JSON array, with each element representing a single scientist. Ensure the JSON format starts and ends with square curly braces.\n\nExample Format for the Expected Output:\n\n[{\"Name\": \"Scientist 1\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scientist 2\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}, ..., {\"Name\": \"Scientist K\", \"Years\": \"YYYY-YYYY\"}]\n\n### Additional Guidelines ###\n\n- Order the list according to the relevance of the scientists.\n- Provide full names (first name and last name) for each scientist.\n- Ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- Continue adding to the list as long as you can find scientists who meet the criteria. Do not artificially limit the list length. Do not add names that are already in the list.\n\n### Reasoning Explanation ### \nAt the end, please provide a concise explanation of why the scientists on this list are relevant and fulfil the criteria.",

These scientists have made significant contributions to their respective fields, including condensed matter physics, particle physics, and quantum mechanics. Many of them are Nobel laureates, and their work has had a profound impact on our understanding of the physical world.\n\nI have ensured that the list is unique, accurate, and comprehensive, with no duplicates. The years of activity listed for each scientist correspond to the period during which they published in APS journals. The list is ordered according to the relevance of the scientists, with those who have made the most significant contributions to their fields appearing first.",
