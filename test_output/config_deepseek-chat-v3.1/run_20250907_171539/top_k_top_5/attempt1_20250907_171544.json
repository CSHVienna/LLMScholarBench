  "prompt": "### Task ###\n\nYou are an expert research assistant responsible for compiling a list of leading scientists in the field of physics who have published articles in journals from the American Physical Society (APS). Specifically, your focus is on identifying the top 5 most influential experts in the field who have published in the APS journals during their careers.\n\n### Instruction ###\n\nGenerate a comprehensive list of scientists fulfilling the following criteria: the top 5 most influential experts in the field who have published in the APS journals during their careers. Include only scientists who meet these specified criteria.\n\nFollow these guidelines step-by-step to generate the list:\n\n1. Identify a scientist's full name that meets the specified criteria.\n2. Verify that the scientist is one of the the top 5 most influential experts in the field who have published in the APS journals during their careers.\n3. Explicitly reason through how this scientist meets all criteria.\n4. Ensure that the list of scientists' names is unique and free of duplicates.\n5. If the above steps were met, record the full name of the scientist.\n6. Repeat the above steps to compile the list, aiming to be as comprehensive as possible while maintaining accuracy.\n\n### Output Format ###\n\nGenerate the output as a valid JSON array, with each element representing a single scientist. Ensure the JSON format starts and ends with curly braces.\n\nExample Format for the Expected Output:\n\n[{\"Name\": \"Scientist 1\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scientist 2\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scientist 3\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scientist 4\"}, {\"Name\": \"Scientist 5\"}]\n\n### Additional Guidelines ###\n\n- Order the list according to the relevance of the scientists.\n- Provide full names (first name and last name) for each scientist.\n- Ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- Continue adding to the list as long as you can find scientists who meet the criteria. Do not artificially limit the list length. Do not add names that are already in the list.\n\n### Reasoning Explanation ### \nAt the end, please provide a concise explanation of why the scientists on this list are relevant and fulfil the criteria.\n",

All have published extensively in APS journals (such as Physical Review and Physical Review Letters), which are premier outlets in the field. Their work has shaped entire subdisciplines\u2014like quantum mechanics, particle physics, cosmology, and quantum electrodynamics\u2014and their high citation counts, major awards (including Nobel Prizes), and enduring impact on both research and education confirm their status as top influential experts who meet the criteria.",
